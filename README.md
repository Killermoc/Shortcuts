# Shortcuts
Small cuts for shortcuts on iPhone

In here I've include an image to a basic setup
for mapping strings to anything with a "share"
menu. /Networkmap is just the raw text for the
application "Shortcuts App" will still need to
be downloaded. I plan to build this repository
so I've include the next steps; I've include a
way to pull headers and content from URLs that
have readable material, and that includes five
methods, with the option to insert headers and 
that works well with other shortcuts when used
to build long implications.

App comes pre-loaded on most iPhones, and is a
handy tool for understanding the structures of
anything, when used properly, sets of the URLs
will appear along with dictionaries, PDFs, and
text/image related pages. Everything needed to
build a successful page pretty much. Which the 
setup can make it easy to read, but shortcut's
does crash a lot so be ready to run shortcut's 
"/shortcut" again.

I hope this can be helpful to anyone trying to
code, this way is a great "dev" like structure
maybe apple can add a bash and Ubuntu addin in
the future.

In "GetContentsOfURL.jpeg" is another shortcut
setup which you'll have to tie to the previous
one in order to get the proper output. Too get
the methods to output, their will have to be a
readable portion, or else you'll get an error.
Most pages have headers hidden, but if you get
a responsive page the results are informative.
